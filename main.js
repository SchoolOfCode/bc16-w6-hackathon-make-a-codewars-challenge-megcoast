/**
 * STORY/INTRO
 * 
 * HELLO CHALLENGER!!You are a solo climber facing a daunting rock face known as "Mount Code". As you gaze up at the challenging route ahead, 
 * you notice a series of different holds scattered along the wall, each presenting its own level of difficulty. The holds range from slopers 
 * that require careful gripping to jugs that offer a solid grip, and crimps that demand precise finger strength.
 * 
 * Your goal is to assess the difficulty level of this climbing route so that you can strategize the best sequence of moves to conquer the climb 
 * and reach the summit.
 * 
 * OBJECTIVE
 * 
 * Given a set of hold types, your objective is to work out the overall difficulty of the climb by combining the value of all holds. 
 * 
 * Write a function called getDifficultyOfClimb that takes in an array of strings (climbing hold names) and returns a number value to 
 * represent the difficulty of the climb. The higher the number, the harder the climb!
 * 
 * Names of holds and their difficulty value in points are below: 
 * 
 * A jug hold is worth 1 point
 * A crimp hold is worth 3 points 
 * A sloper hold is worth 5 points 
 * 
 * Below is the climbing route for Mount Code: 
 * 
 * sloper, crimp, sloper, jug, sloper, jug, crimp 
 * 
  HAPPY CLIMBING!

  STRETCH GOAL;
  
After calculating the total difficulty level of your climbing route, use the following difficulty ratings to assess the challenge:

Mild (Easy): Total Difficulty Level <= 10

Spicy (Moderate): 10 < Total Difficulty Level <= 20

Arms on Fire (Challenging): Total Difficulty Level > 20

  //GOOD LUCK!
