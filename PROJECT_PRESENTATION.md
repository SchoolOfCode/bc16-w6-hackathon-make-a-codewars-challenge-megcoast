STORY 

You are a solo climber facing a daunting rock face known as "Code Peak". As you gaze up at the challenging route ahead, you notice a series of different holds scattered along the wall, each presenting its own level of difficulty. The holds range from slopers that require careful gripping to jugs that offer a solid grip, and crimps that demand precise finger strength.

Your goal is to assess the difficulty level of this single climbing route on Code Peak by analyzing the types of holds. Each hold poses a unique challenge, testing your ability to maneuver through the wall effectively. By evaluating the difficulty of each hold, you can strategize the best sequence of moves to conquer the climb and reach the summit.

OBJECTIVE/GOALS OF CHALLENGE

Function getDifficultyOfClimb

Given a set of hold types, your objective is to work out the overall difficulty of the climb by combining the value of all holds. 

Create a code challenge: write a function called getDifficultyOfClimb that takes in a string array of climbing hold names (a sequence of holds that makes up the climbing route) and returns a number value to represent the difficulty of the climb. The higher the number, the harder the climb!

Names of holds and their difficulty value in points are below: 

A jug hold is worth 1 point 
A crimp hold is worth 3 points 
A sloper hold is worth 5 points 

Here is just one of the possible climbing routes for Mount Code (but feel free to pass in any combination of holds that you like): 

sloper, crimp, sloper, jug, sloper, jug, crimp 

Your task is to return the calculated difficulty level of the above route, or your own route, as the output of the function.
